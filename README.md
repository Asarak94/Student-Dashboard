# Student-Dashboard
A Web Portal to organize the project demonstrations. 

UseCase:-

students will demonstrate their projects at six different one-hour long time slots. Up to 6 students can give their demonstrations in a given time slot. The instructor decides to have a registration webpage to allow students to sign up for one of the time slots. A student visiting the page should be able to submit his/her ID, first name, last name, project title, email address, phone number, and book a seat in one of the available time slots. A student is uniquely identified by his/her ID. 

The Web application should show how many free seats are available in each time slot, announcing and blocking all fully booked time slots. After a student makes a data submission, it should check whether the student has been already registered. If not, the data is stored on the server and the student is notified about her registration. Otherwise, if already registered, the student should be prompted to ensure that they want to change the registration to the new section (and removed from the current one they are registered for).
